    <h5>[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator] </h5>
    Ayo<br>
    I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk<br>
    I wanna walk to your front door and knock<br>
    After I start my vehicle<br>
    Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart<br>
    Land at your driveway and put it in park<br>
    Then do the third line of this verse<br>
    Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes<br>
    And we ride through the park, chase the sun<br>
    God, that's all I want, other than air<br>
    Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah<br>
    I want your company, I need your company<br>
    I want you to want from me<br>
    I can't maneuver without you next to me<br>
    It's so complex to me<br>
  <h5>[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]</h5>
    What do you need?<br>
    Do you need bread? Do you need this?<br>
    Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?<br>
    I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead<br>
    What is your wish? It can be granted<br>
    You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa<br>
    Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic<br>
    I do not have self-control<br>
    I am startin' to wonder<br>
    Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)<br>
  <h5>[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]</h5>
    I'm your puppet, you control me<br>
    I'm your puppet, I don't know me<br>
    (Did I wait too long?)<br>
    I'm your puppet<br>
    (Did I wait too long?)<br>
    You control me<br>
    (Did I wait too long?)<br>
    I'm your puppet<br>
    (Did I wait too long?)<br>
    I'm lonely<br>
    'Cause I'm your puppet<br>
    (Puppet, oh)<br>
    You control me (Control me)<br>
    I'm your puppet (Puppet)<br>
    I don't know<br>
    I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)<br>
    You control me (Puppet)<br>
  <h5>[Verse 3: Kanye West]</h5>
    You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me<br>
    Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see<br>
    A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe<br>
    Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe<br>
    ...on a...<br>
    ...on a...<br>
    First, light the weed<br>
    First...<br>
    First... (Got me by a string)<br>
    First... (Got me by a string)<br>
    First... (Got me by a string)<br>
    (Oh, Lord)<br>
  <h5>[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]</h5>
    (La, la, la, la)<br>
    (La, la, la)<br>
    Breathe on a song<br>
    (La, la, la)<br>
    Breathe on a song<br>
    (La, la, la, la, la, la)<br>
    Breathe on a song<br>
    (Cut me loose)<br>
    (La, la, la) <br>
    (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) <br>
    (Cut me loose, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
    But at some point, you come to your senses <br>
